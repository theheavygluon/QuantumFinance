Welcome to the first day. Before discussing various applications to quantum computing in finance, it is crucial to introduce quantum computing in a smooth way. Here, we attempt to introduce it gently by first introducing both classical computation and quantum mechanics. Then, we introduce quantum computing in the context of gates and circuits. Here are the links:

After this theoretical introduction, it is advised that you check out the practical notebook which acts as a tutorial for programming all the ideas introduced in the lectures.
