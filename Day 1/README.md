Welcome to the first day! Before discussing various applications to quantum computing in finance, it is crucial to introduce QC gently. Here, we attempt to do so by first introducing both classical computation and quantum mechanics. Then, we introduce quantum computing in the context of gates and circuits. Here's how to view it:

 - Step 1: Watch intro to QC lecture here: 


After this theoretical introduction, it is advised that you check out the practical notebook which acts as a tutorial for programming all the ideas introduced in the lectures.
