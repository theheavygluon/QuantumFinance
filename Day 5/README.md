## Day 5: Brief Lab Session

For the Final day, we decided to keep it brief but nonetheless interesting. In this section, we go over a very basic example of using a quantum computing algorithm to solve a portfolio optimization problem. 

 - Step 1: Open the notebook (optional but prefered)
 - Step 2: Watch Lecture on https://youtu.be/ziO9EKpdZ4g
 - Step 3: Check out https://qiskit.org/documentation/finance/tutorials/index.html and try to implement other stuff you've learned over the past few days
