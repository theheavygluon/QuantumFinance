## Pre-requisites:

One of the beauties behind learning quantum computing is that on an elementary level, very few pre-requisites are required. This course is designed in a way where the only pre-requisites required are basic linear algebra and classical information processing. To ensure that you have that under your belt, we made those three notebooks which we encourage everyone to read and solve the exercises.

 - Chapter 1 is on vectors and how they are used to represent the state of a qubit
 - Chapter 2 is on operators and how they are used to manipulate the state of a qubit
 - Chapter 3 is on Classical Information and Boolean Logic
