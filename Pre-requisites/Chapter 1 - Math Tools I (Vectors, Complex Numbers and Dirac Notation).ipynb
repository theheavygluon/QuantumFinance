    "  ##  1.1 Complex Numbers\n",
    "  A complex number is a number which takes the following form:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  c = a + ib\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i = \\sqrt{-1}$. This type of number represents a real component ($Re(c) = a)$ and an imaginary component ($Im(c) = b$). \n",
    "  \n",
    "  One can say that a complex number behaves exactly like a 2D vector, which raises interesting properties such as the ability to describe a complex number as a point in a 2D complex plane (_i.e_ a plane where the x-axis represents $a$, and the y-axis represents $ib$). \n",

    "   \n",
    "Before continuing with the mathematical pre-requisites of basic Quantum Computing, allow me to be honest about something. Writing this chapter is very difficult for me. Not because of the high level of technicality required to write about such topics, but rather because I am sacrificing a lot of interesting and beautiful ideas in exchange of practicality and rapidity so that we can move on to the topic of interest on an \"ASAP basis\". The topics of vector spaces and abstract algebra are infinitely more deep and compelling than what I paint their picture to be, so as I said in the introduction, I highly advise looking at other resources. Ok, enough with my rant and back to let's get back to oversimplifying the math.\n",

    "There are several ways of defining a vector. One might introduce them as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_(intrinsic_definition)\">Rank 1 Tensor</a>, or as a quantity that has magnitude and direction, but for the sake of this chapter, we shall assume that you understand the basics and introduce it as an element of a vector space. A vector space is a collection of not only vectors, but a field of scalars and two operations, vector addition and scalar multiplication. The number of dimensions of a vector space can vary, and is based on the number of elements a vector in that space has. For instance, classically speaking, the position of a particle is usually described in a 3D vector-space with vector of form $\\vec{r}(x,y,z)$, while relativistically speaking one would rather use what's called a four-vector to describe a particle's dynamics. A four-vector takes the following form: $\\vec{R}(x,y,z,ct)$ or simply $\\vec{R}(\\vec{r},ct)$ (where $c$ is the speed of light and $t$ is time). This is what is meant by space-time. The reason I mention the relativistic case is to show that a vector space can also be a subspace of another vector space. In QIT, vector spaces will be used not to describe a particle's position, but rather the probabilities of qubits being in certain states. If this is not apparent now, it should be in Chapter 4.\n",

Any operation which takes the form $ua + bv$ is what is known as a linear combination. Linear combinations are very crucial to the topic of quantum computation because it is essentially how one represents a superposition, but that will be further discussed later on. "

    "   ##  1.5 Dirac Notation \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Anyone who has taken a course in physics knows that vectors are a very powerful tool for representing systems. In quantum mechanics and quantum computing, a vector is used to represent the state of a system (i.e a wavefunction/statevector). The vector notation that is generally used to describe such quantities is usually an idiosyncratic notation called Dirac Notation (or Bracket Notation). One might ask, \"Why use a different notation? The ones used in the earlier sections and generally throughout math and physics seem fine enough. What benifit do we get out of using this new notation?\" The reason Dirac Notation is used is because as you'll see in the later chapters, quantum states get messy to describe. Filled with hermition adjoints, tensor products, and hefty integrals and sums, it eventually gets difficult to keep track of everything that's going on. Dirac Notation does a good job of making it simpler to do all the manipulations required while explicitly separating the state from its dual (something we'll speak about later on).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  There are two main components in Dirac Notation, a bra vector $<u|$ and a ket vector $|v>$. In simple terms, a ket is represented by a column matrix, i.e\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  |u> = \\begin{pmatrix}u_1 \\\\\\ u_2 \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ u_n \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  and a bra is what is called the Hermitian Conjugate of a ket. Hermitian Conjugation is the act of taking the transpose of the complex conjugate of a matrix. While we have spoken about complex conjugation, we haven't yet defined what a transpose is. A transpose is an operation on a matrix that applies the following transformation:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  M_{ij} \\rightarrow M_{ji}\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  where $M$ is a matrix and $i$ and $j$ represent the row and column index, respectively. Given that a ket vector is a column matrix, one can notice that the transpose of a ket vector is essentially a row matrix ($M_{1j} \\rightarrow  M_{j1}$). And since a Hermitian conjugate, denoted by $M^{\\dagger}$ does the following,\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  M^{\\dagger} = M^{T*}\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  one can find that a bra vector, $<u|$, takes the following form:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  <u| = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1^* & u_2^* & \\ldots & u_n^* \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  So, in simple terms, a bra vector is a column matrix that contains the complex conjugates of the components of a ket matrix (which represents the state of the quantum system).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  So we defined what a bra is, and what a ket is, but what is a bra(c)ket? Say we have vectors $\\vec{u}$ and vectors $\\vec{v}$, where both $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v} \\in C^n$, the bracket would be evaluated as follows:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  <u|v> = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1^* & u_2^* & \\ldots & u_n^* \\end{pmatrix} * \\begin{pmatrix}v_1 \\\\\\ v_2  \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ u_n \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  According to <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/v/multiplying-a-matrix-by-a-matrix'>matrix multiplication</a>, this expands to \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  <u|v> = u_1^*v_1 + u_2^*v_2 + \\ldots + u_n^*v_n\n",

    "  <u|v> = \\sum_{i=1}^n u_i^*v_i\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This result is interesting because, as shown in Section 1.4, this is essentially the inner product of vectors $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v}$. From that, we can derive that the norm of vector $\\vec{u}$ could be described by \n",

    "You just went through a crash course of basic vector algebra and probably want a quick answer as to how you will use all of this stuff before having to go through the other two prerequisite chapters. I understand your concern, so here is your quick introduction to quantum computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum computer is any device which, in one way or another, utilizes the laws of quantum mechanics to perform logical operations. As we will show in the next chapter, a key property of quantum mechanics is that the physical systems it describes are intrinsically random. In other words, they are not in a definite state, but rather in a linear combination of all possible states. This is what is known as superposition. As hinted throughout this section, one would use a vector called the statevector to describe the probability of finding a particle in any given state. The number of dimensions of the statevector is equal to the number of possible states a system can be in. This statevector is represented by a ket as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "|\\Psi> = \\begin{pmatrix}\\psi_1 \\\\\\ \\psi_2  \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ \\psi_n \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\psi_i$ is a complex number that represents the a quantity called the amplitude for the $i$th state (where $i$ is between 1 and $n$). The importance of the amplitude is that when squared, it yields the probability of the system being in state $i$. Another way to represent this is by treating the main statevector |$\\Psi$> as a linear combination of basis vectors in an n-dimensional Hilbert space (as you can see, around half of the concepts we learned came up in this one sentence... so read it a few times). This would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "|\\Psi> = \\psi_1 |1> + \\psi_2 |2> + \\ldots + \\psi_n |n> = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\psi_i|i>\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "   \n",
    "   As stated above, $|\\psi_1|^2$ is the probability of finding a system in state 1, $|\\psi_2|^2$ is the probability of finding a particle in state 2 and so on. From there, it would be easy to deduce that the sum of all the amplitudes squared, or $\\sum_{i=1}^n |\\psi_i|^2$ must be equal to the total probability of the system, which should be 1. However, remember that according to Section 1.2, $|\\psi_i|^2 = \\psi_i^* \\psi_i$, which means that the sum of all amplitudes multiplied by their corresponding conjugates must equal 1. Recall that this essentially means that the norm of the vector is 1, which, when written out in Dirac Notation, takes the following form:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \\begin{equation}\n",
    "   <\\Psi|\\Psi> = 1\n",
    "   \\end{equation}\n",
    "   \n",
    " I know what you're thinking. \"Ok, Adam... all this vector stuff sounds cool but what do you mean by state? State of what?\". State could mean several things. It could mean position, momentum, or any property of the system. It is just a matter of giving the statevector context about that state (i.e defining what propery to apply it to). If one would want to study the amplitude distribution of a particle's position $x$, then they have to evaluate the following inner product:\n",
    " \n",
    " \\begin{equation}\n",
    " <x|\\psi>\n",
    " \\end{equation}\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " And similarly for momentum $p$, $<p|\\psi>$. These inner products yield what is known as the wavefunction, which describe a system's amplitude as a function of the physical quantity (e.g $\\psi(x)$ for position).\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Qubit\n",
    " \n",
    " The segment above was a (frankly poor) introduction to what a statevector and wavefunction mean in quantum mechanics. But how does that explain what a quantum computer does, or equally importantly, how quantum information is represented? In a classical computer, information is simply represented by two possible **definite** states: a 0 or a 1. Anything that is in one of those states is called a bit. The function of a classical computer is to manipulate a series of bits according to its given instruction in order to create either cool things like GTA 5, or uncool things like TikTok.\n",
    " \n",
    " However, as described above, the principles of quantum mechanics are inherently random (non-deterministic), meaning that information (such as a bit) cannot be in a definite state, but rather in a linear combination of states defined by a statevector $|\\psi>$. In this case, given that there are only two possible states a, 1 or 0, a quantum bit's (or for short, qubit's) quantum state will be represented by a superposition (linear combination) of state $|0>$ and state |1>. Technically speaking, this would mean that a qubit is a two level quantum system represented by a ket in 2D Hilbert space:\n",
    " \n",
    " \\begin{equation}\n",
    " |\\psi> = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1>\n",
    " \\end{equation}\n",
    " \n",

    " \n",
    " \\begin{equation}\n",
    " |0> = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} and |1> = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    " \\end{equation}\n",
