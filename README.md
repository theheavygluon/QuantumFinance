# Introduction to Quantum Finance

Quantum Computation is attracting an ever-increasing amount of research interest, hype and concequently, funding (both academic and commercial). One industry that seems to be particularly interested in the utilization of quantum computers is the finance industry. This mini-course is designed to introduce basic Quantum Computing and display a few examples of how it can be applied to the world of finance. The target audience is undergraduates in quantitative fields such as physics, math, computer science (and even finance).

In this course, one will find that each topic has the following resources: Theoretical lecture (uploaded to YouTube), Jupyter Notebook (Coding Implementation in IBM's <a href=https://qiskit.org>Qiskit </a> library) and a problem set.

## Pre-requisites:

One of the beauties behind learning quantum computing is that on an elementary level, very few pre-requisites are required. This course is designed in a way where the only pre-requisites required are basic linear algebra and classical information processing. To ensure that everyone has those under their belts before attending the crash course, we made those three notebooks which we encourage everyone to read and solve the exercises.

 - Chapter 1 is on vectors and how they are used to represent the state of a qubit
 - Chapter 2 is on operators and how they are used to manipulate the state of a qubit
 - Chapter 3 is on Classical Information and Boolean Logic
