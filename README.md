## **About the Authors** 

**Course creators:** Jack Streeter, Edward Hall, Adam Fattal-Dakmak and Alice Bru.

We are a group of students studying Physics at Durham University. We hope this introductory course will help you gain an insight into some applications of quantum computing in finance. Hopefully inspire you to consider the many career possibilities in the financial world, as well as the importance that physics has in this sector.

## **Introduction** 

**Welcome** to this introductory course on the applications of Quantum Physics in the financial world. In this course we will be taking you through several applications of Quantum Computational methods in various financial situations through several lecture videos as well as showing you a few examples of these with some coding exercises.

Quantum Computation is attracting an ever-increasing amount of research interest, hype and consequently, funding (both academic and commercial). One industry that seems to be particularly interested in the utilization of quantum computers is the finance industry. This mini-course is designed to introduce basic Quantum Computing and display a few examples of how it can be applied to the world of finance. The target audience is undergraduates in quantitative fields such as physics, math, computer science (and even finance).

_In this course, one will find that each topic has the following resources: Theoretical lecture (uploaded to YouTube), Jupyter Notebook (Coding Implementation in IBM's <a href=https://qiskit.org>Qiskit </a> library) and a problem set._

> "One who finds the niche of quantum computing application will become the new market leader" _Viacheslav Petrenko_

## The Course 

This course consists of five seperate days of lecture videos to watch as well as lecture notes to refer to for more information. 

**Day 1** will...ADAM

**Day 2** will introduce Quantum Risk Analysis, and its importance in everyday financial operations.


**Day 3** will introduce Classical and Quantum Machine Learning and algorithms that can be used in areas of finance such as supply chain management and credit scoring.

**Day 4** will introduce the use of Quantum Computing in Portfolio Optimization.

and finally **Day 5** will...ADAM
