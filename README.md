## **Introduction** 

**Welcome** to this introductory course on the applications of Quantum Physics in the financial world. In this course we will be taking you through several applications of Quantum Computational methods in various financial situations through several lecture videos as well as showing you a few examples of these with some coding exercises.

Quantum Computation is attracting an ever-increasing amount of research interest, hype and consequently, funding (both academic and commercial). One industry that seems to be particularly interested in the utilization of quantum computers is the finance industry. This mini-course is designed to introduce basic Quantum Computing and display a few examples of how it can be applied to the world of finance. The target audience is undergraduates in quantitative fields such as physics, math, computer science (and even finance).

## Table of Content 

**Pre-requisites**: The pre-requisite folder contains three chapters; one on vectors (quantum states), one on matrices (quantum operators) and one on classical computation. It is very advised to look through them before going through the other content. 

**Day 1:** introduces quantum computation both theoretically and practically.  

**Day 2:** introduces Quantum Risk Analysis, and its importance in everyday financial operations.


**Day 3:** introduces Classical and Quantum Machine Learning and algorithms that can be used in areas of finance such as supply chain management and credit scoring.

**Day 4:** introduces the use of Quantum Computing in Portfolio Optimization.

**Day 5:** a lab session that applies the content on day 4 to optimize a 5 stock portfolio.
