## **About the Authors** 

**Course creators:** Jack Streeter, Edward Hall, Adam Fattal-Dakmak and Alice Bru.

We are a group of students studying Physics at Durham University. We hope this introductory course will help you gain an insight into some applications of quantum computing in finance. Hopefully inspire you to consider the many career possibilities in the financial world, as well as the importance that physics has in this sector.

## **Introduction** 

**Welcome** to this introductory course on the applications of Quantum Physics in the financial world. In this course we will be taking you through several applications of Quantum Computational methods in various financial situations and showing you examples of these in some coding exercises.

_Quantum Computation is attracting an ever-increasing amount of research interest, hype and concequently, funding (both academic and commercial). One industry that seems to be particularly interested in the utilization of quantum computers is the finance industry. This mini-course is designed to introduce basic Quantum Computing and display a few examples of how it can be applied to the world of finance. The target audience is undergraduates in quantitative fields such as physics, math, computer science (and even finance)._

_In this course, one will find that each topic has the following resources: Theoretical lecture (uploaded to YouTube), Jupyter Notebook (Coding Implementation in IBM's <a href=https://qiskit.org>Qiskit </a> library) and a problem set._

> "One who finds the niche of quantum computing application will become the new market leader" _Viacheslav Petrenko_

## Pre-requisites:

_One of the beauties behind learning quantum computing is that on an elementary level, very few pre-requisites are required. This course is designed in a way where the only pre-requisites required are basic linear algebra and classical information processing. To ensure that everyone has those under their belts before attending the crash course, we made those three notebooks which we encourage everyone to read and solve the exercises.
_
 - Chapter 1 is on vectors and how they are used to represent the state of a qubit
 - Chapter 2 is on operators and how they are used to manipulate the state of a qubit
 - Chapter 3 is on Classical Information and Boolean Logic
